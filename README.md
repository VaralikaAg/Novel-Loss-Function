# Novel-Loss-Function
Developed a novel loss function by combining Huber Loss and Mean Squared Error (MSE) to enhance performance in time series predictions. This new loss function was evaluated on two time series datasets, aiming to minimize both the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) metrics compared to using MAE Loss and MSE Loss individually, while also ensuring smoother predicted values.
