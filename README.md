# Novel-Loss-Function
Developed a novel loss function by modifying the original one, combining Huber loss and Mean Squared Error (MSE) to enhance performance in time series predictions. This new loss function was tested on two time series datasets, aiming to reduce the MSE metric while ensuring smoothness in the predicted values.
